# Example configuration for the M913 mouse
# If a particular option is not specified a default value will be used

# The M913 has two profiles that can be switched using the 'mode switch' button on the bottom of the mouse.
# However writing or reading the settings can only be done for the active profile, therefore only profile1 is used in the config.
